# MWinLib
A small Win32 library for easily creating windows.

Still under construction!


For now, you can check out a demo at [Demo.cpp](https://github.com/m-doescode/MWinLib/blob/master/MWinLib/Demo.cpp)

For the library itself, simply copy the [mwinlib](https://github.com/m-doescode/MWinLib/tree/master/MWinLib/mwinlib) folder in MWinLib.
(This may be included in releases in the future)
